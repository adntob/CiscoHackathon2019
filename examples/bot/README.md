# Webex Weather Bot

If you say `weather` to the bot ('ToresWeatherBot'), it will reply to you with a random weather forecast for tomorrow.

This bot uses the new web socket API (not web hooks), so it should be possible to run on a local laptop that is not publicly accesible on the Internet (no need for ngrok).

## Run example

``` shell
cd examples/bot
node bot.js
```
